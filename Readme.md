## Summary of My Experience with the Course
As a whole, I feel like the course was a useful refresher on how to use git effectively. It motivated me to figure out how to incorporate github into my typical workflow (previously, I only used local git or my/a friends’ VPS as a remote repository). It also (indirectly) led me to find some nice plugins for Subliime Text to streamline my workflow, and helped me find git-flow, which is a useful library for managing multiple branches of a project in a much more user-friendly fashion. 

I didn’t learn as much as others may have from the course, but that is largely due to the fact that I have prior experience with git as a tool. This also caused me to end up skipping around a lot on the course. I do think that the lessons could’ve been organized a little better: mainly having a student install git before teaching them the basics of diffs and commits and such.
